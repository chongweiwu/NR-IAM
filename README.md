# Noise Removed Inconsistency Activation Map for Unsupervised Registration of Brain Tumor MRI between Pre-operative and Follow-up Phases
This is the implementation of the NR-IAM: **Noise Removed Inconsistency Activation Map for Unsupervised Registration of Brain Tumor MRI between Pre-operative and Follow-up Phases** 

## Visualization Results
The visualization of our proposed NR-IAM in T1 and T2 modality on [BraTS-Reg dataset](https://www.med.upenn.edu/cbica/brats-reg-challenge). The regions hilighted in the yellow box prove that our NR-IAM can precisely locate the inconsistency across different MRI modality on BraTS-Reg.
